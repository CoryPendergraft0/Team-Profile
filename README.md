## Description
  Your challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.
